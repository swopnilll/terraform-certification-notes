- **What Are Terraform Resources?**\
   Terraform resources represent real-world entities, such as an AWS S3 bucket, a Google Cloud folder, or a Postgres role. They form the foundation of your infrastructure as code.

  js```
  resource "aws_s3_bucket" "first_bucket" {
  bucket = "<yourname>-first-bucket"
  }

- **Naming Convention:**\
  The resource type begins with the provider name followed by an underscore (e.g., `aws_s3_bucket`, `google_folder`, `postgresql_role`). This makes it clear which vendor or service the resource belongs to.

- **Resource Identifier:**\
  The last word in quotes (for example, `"first_bucket"`) is the resource's unique identifier within your Terraform project. It lets you refer to that specific instance later in your code.

- **Resource Properties:**\
  Each resource has key-value pairs that define its properties. Some are mandatory (like the name for an S3 bucket), while others are optional. Properties can also be nested (e.g., versioning settings) and can have different data types (strings vs. booleans).

- **Customization Through Properties:**\
  You can customize your resources by adding various properties. For example, setting the S3 bucket's `acl` property to `private` or enabling versioning with specific options.

- **Provider Documentation:**\
  For any resource, you can refer to the respective Terraform provider documentation to see a complete list of available properties and configuration options.
